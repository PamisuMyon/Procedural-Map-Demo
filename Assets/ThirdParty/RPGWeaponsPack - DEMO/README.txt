To use: Drag and drop prefabs from Prefabs folder into scene and assemble to fit your needs.

Tip: To achieve intended graphical results, switch Color Space (Project Settings > Player > Other Settings) from Gamma 
to Linear.

Note: Package was made and assembled in Unity's built-in render pipeline. HDRP currently not supported. Materials require conversion when 
importing into URP (Edit > Render Pipeline > Universal Render Pipeline > Upgrade Project Materials to UniversalRP Materials). Media images 
and screenshots were built and rendered in Blender. Email me if you have any questions!
